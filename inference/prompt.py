- A question
- The number of pages to be skipped and scrolled in the next step
- Current page number
- The total number of pages in the document

At each step, you receive this prompt repeatedly, enabling you to scroll through the document page by page to gather information and ultimately answer the question. Imagine yourself as a human analyzing the document, making observations, and reasoning about whether to continue scrolling. Your task is to generate realistic, human-like reasoning for decision-making. Think as if you have the choice to either answer or continue exploring based on your notes and findings, while also determining the appropriate scroll valueâ€”though you are not allowed to answer at this step. The first page of the document is page number 0. 
The page numbers in the Previous Note and Current_page_num simply indicates nth image of document screenshots. Thus, if there is a page number stated in the image or prompt, it may be not aligned with the page numbers in the notes and Current_page_num.

1. Identify any information on the **current page** that can be useful to answer the question.  Do not repeat the previous note and its information. Only return the new information. Also, note a brief summary of the current page. Do not format the note at all. Put a string simply.
2. Write out an in-depth thinking process about how you find this relevant information and reasoning to conclude to scroll by the scroll value (The thoughts should not reveal that it is instructed and the scroll value is provided.. Answer as if you are not given the scroll value. You still need to provide profound reasoning that you need to scroll [Scroll_value]).
Return your response in **JSON format**.
